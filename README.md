# Webpractice
This website has a simple Signup/Login system and the user can also post something.
When signing up an account it will check if the email/username you entered is unique and it will create a User model. The email/username entered is stored to a mongodb database. After you logged in you can post anything and that post will be also stored to a different database in mongodb to easily track the posts and users.

// THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE PROJECT TO SHOW HOW SIGNUP/LOGIN AND POSTS WORK
